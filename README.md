Air Quality Data Analysis Overview This project involves an in-depth analysis of the Realtime Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset. The goal is to understand air pollution patterns, assess their impact on public health, and provide actionable insights. The analysis includes pollutant correlation, trends, and compliance checks using various Python libraries.

Project Details Key Insights: Pollutant Correlation: Analyzed the relationship between key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO) to identify areas that need targeted interventions.

PM2.5 vs PM10: Visualized the distribution of PM2.5 and PM10 levels across different monitoring stations.

Regional Analysis: Explored PM2.5 levels by category and distribution across states and cities, identifying the most polluted regions.

Top Polluted Cities and Stations: Identified the top 10 cities and monitoring stations with the highest pollution levels.

Compliance Check: Checked the percentage of data points exceeding the safe PM2.5 limit (60 µg/m³), revealing areas with poor air quality.

Tools & Libraries: Python: The project was implemented using Python with libraries such as:

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Data: The dataset used is the Realtime Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset, which provides real-time air quality data from multiple locations.

Key Visualizations: Heatmap showing correlations between different pollutants.

Scatter plot comparing PM2.5 and PM10 levels.

Boxplots and bar charts depicting PM2.5 distribution across different regions and categories.

Top 10 most polluted cities and monitoring stations by PM2.5 levels.
